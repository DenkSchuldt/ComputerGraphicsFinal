Geometric Shaper
A manipulation tool for 3D geometric figures, starting with 2D sketches.

To start shaping you can either draw a circle, a square or a triangle.
Once the App recognizes the drawn sketch, it will display all the options for that shape, so you can drag and drop the object that fits well your needs.
The object placed in the working area can later be translated, rotated or scaled. This can be achieved by clicking the "cursor" symbol at the bottom right corner of the working area, turning it into a "pencil". This means, the current working style is the "Cursor", for doing one of the possible modifications to the object.
Clicking one object with the "Cursor" style, will show the 3 axis for translating the object. Clicking it right away again will turn the axis into bounding circles around the object, meaning the rotation modifier is active. Clicking once again the object, will turn the guiding circles into axis, but this time showing the scale modifiers.
Clicking the axis or the guiding circles will modify the object on that axis. For translating and scaling, clicking the center of the object will modify the object gradually and evenly.
At any time, you can add a texture to the object, selecting it from the "Textures" menu at the upper right corner of the working area and dragging it to the object.
The lightbulb symbol will show two different lighting methods that can be dropped into the working area.
Selecting the "circle" symbol shows the color menu. One color can be dragged and dropped into an object and it will turn that object to the same color, even if it has a texture on it.
Finally, if the "Pencil" working style is selected, you can scribble over an object to delete it.
